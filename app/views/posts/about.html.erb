        <p class="description">I am a relentlessly curious person. I have many interests and passions in my life. I received a degree in Graphic Design from Portland State in 2017. I studied many aspects of design: branding, layout, typography, motion graphics, illustration, etc. I had a difficult time choosing which one to focus on because I enjoyed them all. Eventually I decided on web development because it incorporated all the aspects of design into one area of focus. Once I began writing code, I realized that I loved problem solving and creating applications in code. It felt very natural and creative.</p>

        <p class="description">After getting my feet wet in coding for design, I decided to pursue web development as a career. I recently graduated from the Epicodus coding school in downtown Portland. I use the design principles I learned in school to develop websites that go above and beyond the normal and mundane. Understanding typography, branding and layout gives me a distinct advantage when I am working on a website.</p>
